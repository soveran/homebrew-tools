### clac

A command line, stack-based calculator with postfix notation that
displays the stack contents at all times. As you type, the stack
changes are reflected immediately.

```shell
$ brew install clac
```

### prep

Prep is a tool for prefixing blocks of text. It reads from stdin,
detects the indentation of the first line and proceeds to prepend
the passed prefix to each line. If the prefix argument is omited
it defaults to `#`. Lines containing only white space are preserved.

```shell
$ brew install prep
```
